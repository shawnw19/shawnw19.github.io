# Three Dimensions Of Computing

The questions asked in previous article regarding the essences apart from TM/LC could be preliminarily answered:
Yes, there are other dimenstions of modern computing.

The term computing, or modern computing should be defined as computation using electronic computer, which is structured and ubiquitous.

The computation in prior to modern computing is mainly done with arbitrary symbolic forms and empiric knowledge, such as most mathematics and rule-of-thumbs in daily life. Modern computing, on the other hand, favours discrete structures and commonly used symbols.

The three dimensions of computing are:

1 Process. The is the main dimension behind functional programming, stream computing and reactive programming. Its essense is sequence. What Lambda Calculus and Turing Machine describe is a sequential process either in relation-like form (LC) or in discrete time (TM). 

2 Object. This dimension deals with persistence of status. Computing is a process of changing status and changes, although can be ephemeral, is associated with continuous existence. Object-oriented programming deals with messaging among objects. The persistence/existence of (often narrow sensed) objects is the foundation of interactions, messaging and other forms of status change.

3 Interface. Unlike maths and formal logics, computing is done through rigid programming languages and/or the software built upon them. The electronic computer is built on architectures with definite hardware-software interfaces and hardware-hardware interfaces. Service in Web is itself an interface. The development of Web makes api-oriented programming popular.

The process dimension proved that the computation can be done in atomic and recursive way and forboded the electronic computing; it is rather related to a monolithic program and operating system. 

The object dimension represents the memory including databases. 

The interface dimension represents interoperability and interaction (GUI etc). In 1960s IBM tried to apply some interoperable small programs on its database systems and this is an early start.

The object could be explained as a special case of processes in terms of the execution of program in CPU's level that the persistent status can be regarded as nonexisting before it is fetched, but the status is not created, nor will it evaporate automatically after usage. The process itself, when stored and reused can also be regarded as a special "object".

The relationship between the process and object can be tricky when types come in. In many programming languages stand-alone procedures/functions are not welcomed and even forbidded. In Java all methods (functions) must be associated with a class (prototype). The types of formal parameters of the method is very important and is related to namespaces. This is actually a general requirement in programming languages regarding to the interface.
